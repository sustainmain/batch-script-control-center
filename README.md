# batch-script-control-center

This is an old project I made to quickly get to the programs and websites I used most often. 

## Getting started

Open `control-center.bat`

To view the list of commands, type help. This will display the contents of `command-list.txt`. The list of built-in commands are baked in to the main program, while the others are called from `commands.bat`.

Custom commands can be added using the `add` command. The command will be added to the `command-list.txt` and `commands.bat` files. To remove the command, you have to manually edit those files.
